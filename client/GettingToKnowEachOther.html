        <h4 style="text-align:center;color: blue; ">Introduction</h4>
        <p>I am Mexican American, I was born in Berwyn but I grew up in Joliet. I have 2 siblings, an older brother
            and a younger sister. My older brother just graduated college and my younger sister is a sophomore in college.
            My parents are both from Mexico, my mom is from San Louis and my dad is from Mexico City. I am majoring in computer Science because I like to problem solve and experiment with new technology
            so computer science suits all of my wants in a career. I have always liked to solve puzzles and creating a piece of code is like putting
            a puzzle together.

            <li style="list-style-position: inside;">I hope to learn how to work in a group on one piece of code</li>

        </ul>
        <h4 style="text-align:center;color: blue;">My Favorite Hobby and / Activity</h4>
        <p>I like to train in MMA, play video games, watch movies/tv shows, and I have just recently gotten into Chess. I started
            training at an MMA gym when I started college my freshman year. It started as a hobby but I eventually grew a passion
            for the sport and find myself coming back to it even if I try to take a break. I have played video games my whole life since 
            I was a child. My dad let me play Call of Duty at the age of 7 and I still continue to play it to this day. It is a stress reliever
            for me and lets me clear my mind. I had just recently gotten into Chess, I felt like I had the same routine for the longest time
            and felt a need to pick up a new hobby so I chose Chess. Chess is a game of strategy and critical thinking which reminds me 
            of computer science so I grew fond of the game quick.

        <h4 style="text-align:center;color: blue;">Fun Fact</h4>
        <p title="FunFact">
            A fun fact about myself is that after years of training at the MMA gym, the coaches at the gym had asked me to coach the boxing class.
            My original coach had left to go fight in Atlanta and pursue his boxing career as a professional fighter(He took first in nationals this year).
            When he left my other coach asked if I had wanted to takeover and I had agreed.
